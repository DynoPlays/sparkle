## Common Questions
> Q: How do I install the modpack?
> 
> A: Download and install the Modrinth app on https://modrinth.com/app, then click "Download" at the top of the page and click "Install with Modrinth App".

> Q: Is this secure & can I get banned on servers for using this?
> 
> A: Sparkle is completly safe and all mods were carefully reviewed for any potential malware. Your chances of getting banned on a Minecraft server for using our modpack is almost impossible, however please make sure the server's rules do not state you cannot use client-sided mods.

> Q: Is there a download for the Curseforge app?
> 
> A: No, there isn't since many mods included in Sparkle aren't on Curseforge. We have also decided to stay away from Curseforge.

> Q: Does this support mobile?
> 
> A: No, Sparkle doesn't support mobile as it's only avaiable on java edition. PojavLauncher and other similar projects are also not supported due to incompatibilities between certain mods and PojavLauncher.
