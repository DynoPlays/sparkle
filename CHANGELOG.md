# Sparkle Changelogs

## 1.21.5

### Sparkle 2.0.0

### Welcome back! ðŸ˜Ž

It has been 9 months since the last release of **Sparkle âœ¨** and we're back better than ever! Here is a little teaser:

- Our modpack is no longer based off of Fabulously Optimized, meaning Sparkle is faster than ever!
- We've removed all custom block textures, animations, etc. to solely focus on improving the user experience while keeping the default vanilla feel.
- We've added a BUNCH of brand new QoL features to Minecraft to make your lives even easier without feeling like you're using cheats.
- Sparkle is now **completely client-sided** and doesn't affect the server at all.

### What's next?
Sparkle will receive more updates and we're working on a version features **NeoForge ðŸ¦Š** instead of Fabric, so you can play with your favourite mods such as Create, etc.

Thank you for all the support :)
